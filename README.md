## 🌳 Introduction...  🖥️ 

The **Bootcamp of the Full-stack Java Developer** is akin to a journey through Middle-earth, a 3-month odyssey sponsored by [**Generation Brazil**](https://brazil.generation.org/), where each leg of the journey focuses on different realms of technology. Yet, woven into the fabric of this quest are the vital non-technical skills, the soft skills, which are not merely discussed but lived and breathed each passing day. Behold, the virtues that are honed and celebrated daily:

- [x] Proactivity, the spark that ignites new ventures;
- [x] Teamwork, the fellowship that binds us together;
- [x] Communication, the language that bridges worlds;
- [x] Personal responsibility, the mantle we bear as stewards of our own fate;
- [x] Empathy, the gift of understanding amidst diverse journeys;
- [x] Attention to detail, the meticulous craft of the artisan;
- [x] Orientation to the future, the compass guiding our tomorrows;
- [x] Persistence, the steadfast resolve in the face of adversity.



For it is not only the technical prowess we seek to forge, but also the refinement of these behavioral skills, which I dare say, are the true treasures of any noble endeavor.

Amidst the misty realms of code and creation, a journey unfolds, akin to the tales of Middle-earth.
&nbsp;

Behold, the Trilha Zero, where the paths of technomancers and aspiring sorcerers converge.
&nbsp;

During this period, I traversed the enchanted lands of the **Portugol** tongue, delving into its ancient syntax and arcane algorithms.

&nbsp;

In this phase, I embarked on a journey through the lands of Java, delving deep into its mysteries for one moon's cycle. To uncover the knowledge I acquired, venture forth to the folder `Bloco_01/java` within this repository:
[**Java**](https://github.com/caoslourenco/Generation_Bootcamp_Java/tree/main/Bloco_01).
Furthermore, I wielded the enchanted Notion app to chronicle my learnings from the sagas shared in the [**My cookBook**](https://www.notion.so/camillalourenco/cookbook_java-96759ce7318749e0b76690768876225a), bestowed upon students by the wise scholars.

- [ ] Scrolls of wisdom on [**Java**](https://github.com/free-educa/books/blob/main/books/JavaScript%20O%20Guia%20Definitivo_v2.pdf);
- [ ] Tome of lore on the introduction to [**Git and Github**](https://github.com/caoslourenco/Generation_Bootcamp_Java/tree/main/Bloco_01/git);
- [ ] Brief chronicle of the Java project: [**GenStudents**](https://github.com/caoslourenco/Generation_Bootcamp_Java/tree/main/Bloco_01/java);
- [ ] Scroll of guidance on the sacred journey: [**Generation First Project**](https://github.com/caoslourenco/Conta_Bancaria);

### 🛠️ Final Project: Not Completed Yet

I ventured into the realm of [**Final Project**](https://github.com/caoslourenco/Project_01), where the quest remains ongoing, awaiting its grand completion.

The fellowship I journeyed with remains a tale yet untold: ?

With this valiant fellowship, I witnessed firsthand the first pillar of the agile manifesto in action: **_Individuals and interactions over processes and tools._**
