## 🚪 Introduction...  🖥️

The **Bootcamp Java Full-stack developer** is a 3-month scholarship program by [**Generation Brazil**](https://brazil.generation.org/), with each focused on different technologies. Additionally, there is ample emphasis on learning non-technical skills (soft skills), which are constantly addressed and practiced every day. These are the skills discussed daily:

- [x] Proactivity;
- [x] Teamwork;
- [x] Communication;
- [x] Personal responsibility;
- [x] Empathy;
- [x] Attention to detail;
- [x] Orientation to the future;
- [x] Persistence.

The idea is not only to develop technically but also to acquire/improve behavioral skills, which I consider more important in any field.
