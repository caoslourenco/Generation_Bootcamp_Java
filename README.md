## 🚪 Introduction...  🖥️

The **Bootcamp of the Full-stack Java Developer** is akin to a journey through Middle-earth, a 3-month odyssey sponsored by [**Generation Brazil**](https://brazil.generation.org/), where each leg of the journey focuses on different realms of technology. Yet, woven into the fabric of this quest are the vital non-technical skills, the soft skills, which are not merely discussed but lived and breathed each passing day. Behold, the virtues that are honed and celebrated daily:

- [x] Proactivity, the spark that ignites new ventures;
- [x] Teamwork, the fellowship that binds us together;
- [x] Communication, the language that bridges worlds;
- [x] Personal responsibility, the mantle we bear as stewards of our own fate;
- [x] Empathy, the gift of understanding amidst diverse journeys;
- [x] Attention to detail, the meticulous craft of the artisan;
- [x] Orientation to the future, the compass guiding our tomorrows;
- [x] Persistence, the steadfast resolve in the face of adversity.

For it is not only the technical prowess we seek to forge, but also the refinement of these behavioral skills, which I dare say, are the true treasures of any noble endeavor.
